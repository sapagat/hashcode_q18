# Hash Code Online Qualification 2018: Self-Driving Rides

This repository contains the scoring and a possible approach to solve
the Self-Driving rides problem from the Online Qualification Round of Hash
Code 2018.

## Set up

Build the docker image:

```
docker-compose build
```

Set up the example datasets:

- Create `input` and `output` directories in the root of this project
- Copy `examples/a_example.in` to `input/a_example.in`
- Copy `examples/a_example.out` to `output/a_example.out`.

**Notice that the input and output files have the same name with different
extension**


## Score

This will score the simulation based on the formula stated in the PDF. This will
also apply the validations.

```
bundle exec rake rides:score
```

## Plan

You can run a plan as follows:

```
bundle exec rake rides:plan[<name>]
```

The plans are registered in `src/planner`.

The plan record is for `max_next_step` planner:
